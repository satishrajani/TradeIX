Hi Team,

I have created project with POM & TestNg, please run the testng.xml file from the config folder , there are 4 clases for each 
http methods.

if you get error with  dublicate entry error please change the user name from the  input name.


Point to consider 

1. Have not commented anything but each methods are working fine.
2. I could have created resource file and loaded in script (reason for not doing is you guys need to change the path/directory to run, so removed it)
